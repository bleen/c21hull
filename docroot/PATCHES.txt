APACHESOLR
  * In order for numeric filters to work proerly in apachesolr_views I had to
    modify the makeFilterQuery() function by removing the "$" from the regex
    that checks for range querys:

      !preg_match('/^[\[\{]\S+ TO \S+[\]\}]$/', $filter['#value'])
        ...became
      !preg_match('/^[\[\{]\S+ TO \S+[\]\}]/', $filter['#value'])

    For more details, see this issue (original post):
    https://drupal.org/node/2031495

    In addition, this patch allows for multiple filters:

CKEDITOR
  * Added the NodeEmbed & iframedialog plugins to ckeditor.

DATE
  * It's annoying to always see the date_migrate_example module on the features
    page so we made it hidden by adding "hidden = TRUE" to its .info file.

  * The date_migrate submodule needs to be patched to work with the latest
    version of migrate.

DREALTY
  * Exporting the drealty connection to a feature causes things to blow up. See
    https://drupal.org/node/2035301 for details. In the mean time I changed one
    line in drealty.connection.inc. In the
    drealtyConnectionEntityContoller->create() function I changed the default
    value of conid from NULL to 1. This only works for c21hull because we will
    only ever have one connection.

  * Added support for drealty listings to be indexed by the apachesolr module.

    choose "link to content".
