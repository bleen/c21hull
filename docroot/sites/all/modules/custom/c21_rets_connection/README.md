*Do not enable this module.*

This feature should not be enabled. There are some bugs in how the DREALTY
module integrates with Features and enabling this module may cause issue. The
only reason it is here is so that the connection can be built during the initial
site installation. Once the site is live in production, DO NOT enable this.
