This folder contains the SOLR configuration files being used by the c21hull
collection. The majority of the files were simply copied form one of two
locations:

1) ..../docroot/sites/all/modules/custom/apachesolr/solr-conf
2) ..../solr/4.2.1/libexec/example/solr/collection1

When there was a conflict, the files provided by the drupal module won.
